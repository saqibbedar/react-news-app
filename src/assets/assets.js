    description:
      `LAHORE: All six franchises of the HBL Pakistan Super League completed their respective squads for the 10th edition during the players’ draft ceremony held here at the historical Hazuri Bagh, Lahore Fort on Monday.

New Zealand’s Daryl Mitchell became the first pick of the coming season when two-time winners Lahore Qalandars picked him to strengthen their batting order. Mitchell will make his PSL debut this year.

New Zealand’s batting maestro Kane Williamson was one of the prominent signings by Karachi Kings in the supplementary round one.

Former Australian opener David Warner was picked by Kings as they made use of the second pick in the first Platinum round. Warner, with 12,727 T20 runs in 392 T20 matches under his belt, will also be among the PSL debutants.

Peshawar Zalmi used the right to match option for English cricketer Tom Kohler-Cadmore, who was picked by Quetta Gladiators. Kohler-Cadmore has represented Zalmi in the last four PSL seasons. Gladiators then took New Zealand’s Mark Chapman, who has played 81 T20 Internationals.

New Zealand’s Michael Bracewell and Matthew Short of Australia were the last two picks in the Platinum one round as they were gleaned by Multan Sultans and Islamabad United, respectively.

In the Platinum round two, Quetta Gladiators and Karachi Kings had two picks each. Gladiators used their wild card pick option to snare all-rounder Faheem Ashraf.

Aggressive Kiwi opener Finn Allen, 25, was the other player Quetta picked in this round.

Karachi Kings strengthened their pace arsenal as they went for New Zealand pacer Adam Milne as their first pick of the Platinum two round and followed it up by using wild card on fast bowler Abbas Afridi.

The Diamond round of picks saw Peshawar Zalmi, Islamabad United and Lahore Qalandars bag quality overseas talent in South African Corbin Bosch, Jason Holder of West Indies and Sri Lanka’s Kusal Perera, respectively.

Peshawar Zalmi topped up their pace stocks by picking Bangladesh’s Nahid Rana in the Gold category round one.

In the same category, Islamabad United picked Aussie fast bowler Ben Dwarshuis who will join compatriots Riley Meredith and Short on the United roster.

In the Silver category round three Bangladesh spinner Rishad Hossain was roped in by Qalandars. In a first, Andries Gous of the United States made it to the PSL 2025. He will turn up for Islamabad United.

Multan Sultans added Irish pacer Josh Little and West Indies’ spinner Gudakesh Motie to their side during this round.

In the supplementary round one, Kings’ other overseas picks include Afghanistan’s Mohammad Nabi, Warner and Bangladesh’s Litton Das.
West Indies’ Johnson Charles, England’s Tom Curran, Kusal Mendis of Sri Lanka and West Indies’ pacer Alzarri Joseph were bagged by Sultans, Qalandars, Gladiators and Zalmi, respectively in supplementary round one.

In round two, Sam Billings of England was snared by Qalandars who used the right to match card against defending champions Islamabad United, who later added South African batter Rassie van der Dussen to their squad.`,
